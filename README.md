## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is the final project of DSC210 - Numerical Linear Algebra. The goal of this project is to implement and compare different community detection algorithms. The algorithms that are implemented in this project are:

1. Spectral Clustering
2.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hardness1020/Community_Detection/blob/main/main.ipynb)
Click the badge above to run the code in Colab!

The code is written in Python and can be run in Jupyter Notebook. The code is also available in the `main.ipynb` file. The code is written in a modular way, so you can easily run the code by running the cells in the notebook.
