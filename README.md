## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is the final project of DSC210 - Numerical Linear Algebra. The goal of this project is to implement and compare different community detection algorithms. The algorithms implemented in this project are:

1. Spectral Clustering
2. CDNMF: Contrastive Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization

## 📖 Requirement <a name="requirement"></a>

To install the dependencies, please use: `!pip install -r requirements.txt`.

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/hardness1020/Community_Detection/blob/main/main.ipynb)
Click the badge above to run the code in Colab!

The code is implemented in Python and designed to run in Jupyter Notebook. You can find the code in the main.ipynb file. It is modular and structured, allowing you to execute it step-by-step by running the cells in the notebook.
